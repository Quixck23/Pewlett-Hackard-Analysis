# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Proyect overview
Pewlett-Hackard have requested to create a local database that houses all their information, so that all datasets are centrally located. The company is about to have a surge of retiring employees around the same time. At present, the company does not have a concise database that allows it to predict who will leave and how many jobs they will have in the coming years.
